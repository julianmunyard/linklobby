# Phase 4.5: Editor Polish (Mobile) - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Make the editor work flawlessly on mobile devices and handle errors gracefully. This includes:
- Mobile responsive editor with touch-friendly controls
- Mobile-optimized navigation (sidebar/panels)
- Image optimization on upload
- Link URL validation
- Error handling and recovery
- Offline indicator

## Implementation Decisions

### Mobile Layout
- **Sidebar behavior:** Bottom sheet that slides up from bottom when tapped (like mobile maps apps)
- **Preview visibility:** Preview stays visible (dimmed) behind the bottom sheet while editing
- **Card editing:** Tap a card in preview to open its property editor in the bottom sheet
- **Drag reorder:** Long-press (~500ms) to enter drag mode, then move card
- **Breakpoint:** 768px triggers mobile layout (tablets and phones)
- **Tablet handling:** Landscape orientation gets desktop layout, portrait gets mobile layout
- **Add Card:** Both FAB button (+) in corner AND button in cards tab for discoverability
- **Swipe gestures:** Swipe down on bottom sheet to dismiss, swipe left on cards for delete/duplicate actions

### Error Handling
- **Save failures:** Claude's discretion on retry strategy and notification pattern
- **Upload failures:** Inline error in the upload area with retry button (not toast)
- **Offline indicator:** Persistent banner at top: "You're offline - changes won't be saved"
- **No local backup:** Warn user they're offline, but don't cache changes locally

### Image Optimization
- **Compression:** Always auto-compress uploads (e.g., 80% JPEG quality)
- **Formats supported:** JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF (preserve animated GIFs)
- Current 5MB limit remains

### Link Validation
- **Validation timing:** Claude's discretion (on blur, on save, or debounced real-time)
- **Auto-fix:** Add https:// to URLs missing protocol
- **Broken link detection:** Claude's discretion on whether to implement (complexity vs value)

### Claude's Discretion
- Save failure retry strategy (auto-retry count, notification style)
- URL validation timing
- Whether to implement broken link detection (async 404 checking)
- Bottom sheet component choice (existing library vs custom)
- Touch target sizing specifics

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Bottom sheet pattern similar to Google Maps on mobile - slides up, preview visible behind
- FAB button common in mobile apps (Material Design pattern) for primary action
- Swipe-to-delete pattern like iOS Mail app

</specifics>

## Deferred Ideas

None - discussion stayed within phase scope
