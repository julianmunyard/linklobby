# Phase 4.1: Linktree Import - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

One-click import of existing Linktree links to jumpstart an artist's LinkLobby page. Reduces migration friction — artist enters their Linktree username and their links become editable cards.

## Implementation Decisions

### Data to import
- Links (URL + title) — required
- Images/thumbnails — if available
- Descriptions — if available
- Try to get as much as Linktree exposes

### Card type mapping
- Attempt smart detection where possible (e.g., Spotify link → could inform future platform integration)
- Default to Horizontal Link cards (matches Linktree's visual style)
- User can change card types after import

### Import behavior
- One-time import only
- No ongoing sync or connection to Linktree
- Imported cards become regular LinkLobby cards immediately
- User can delete/modify like any other card

### Technical approach
- **Research needed** — best method TBD during phase planning
- Options to investigate: public page scraping, unofficial API, other methods
- Prioritize reliability over complexity

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact scraping/fetching implementation
- Error handling for private/invalid Linktree pages
- UI for import flow (modal, separate page, etc.)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "Limit the effort as much as possible" — keep implementation simple
- Input should just be the username (linktr.ee/username)
- Cards appear on canvas ready to customize

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
