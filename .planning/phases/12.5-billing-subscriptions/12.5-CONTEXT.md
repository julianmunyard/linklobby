# Phase 12.5: Billing & Subscriptions - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Stripe-powered monetization with Free / Pro / Artist tiers. Includes checkout flow, subscription management, plan gating, upgrade prompts, trial period, and graceful degradation on downgrade. Pricing tiers and feature breakdown are defined in ROADMAP.md.

## Implementation Decisions

### Paywall model
- **Soft lock with preview** — Pro features are visible and configurable in the editor, but show a 'Pro' badge and won't go live on the public page until the user upgrades
- Pro badges appear **everywhere** — on editor panel controls, preview cards, and cards sidebar list
- Free users can fully interact with Pro features in the editor (configure email collection, set up pixels, etc.) but they're stripped from the public page

### Theme gating
- **Some themes are Pro-only** — a subset of premium/complex themes require Pro subscription
- Free users can **select, customize, and preview** any theme including Pro-only themes in the editor
- Publishing with a Pro-only theme triggers an upgrade prompt — the page won't go live with that theme until subscribed
- Which themes are Pro vs Free: to be determined during implementation (likely the more complex ones like Lanyard Badge, Departures Board, etc.)

### Checkout flow
- **Stripe Checkout (hosted page)** — user clicks 'Upgrade', redirected to Stripe's hosted checkout, then back to LinkLobby
- **Monthly + annual billing** with ~20% annual discount (e.g. Pro: $12/mo or $115/year)
- **Dedicated /pricing page** — public, visible to logged-out visitors. Full 3-tier comparison with feature table.

### Subscription lifecycle
- **Access until billing period ends**, then downgrade — no immediate cutoff on cancellation
- On downgrade: **Pro content hidden from public page** (still visible in editor with Pro badge for easy re-subscription) AND **page reverts to a free theme** if using a Pro-only theme
- **7-day free trial** of Pro features for new users

### Billing UI
- **Minimal in-app billing section** in Settings — current plan, next billing date, upgrade/cancel buttons
- **Stripe Customer Portal** for invoice history, payment method changes, detailed billing management ("Manage billing" button)
- **Plan badge visible in sidebar + editor header** — text pill badge showing 'Free' / 'Pro' / 'Artist', clicking goes to pricing/upgrade page

### Claude's Discretion
- Whether 7-day trial requires credit card upfront (tradeoff: friction vs conversion)
- Exact Stripe webhook event handling and retry logic
- Database schema for subscription state (stripe_customer_id, plan tier, trial dates)
- Which specific themes are Pro-only vs Free
- Upgrade prompt modal design and copy
- How to handle edge cases (failed payments, disputed charges)

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- "Have all the themes available to try in the preview but the Pro features are behind a paywall, so they can see what they'll get but can't really get it on free" — the core philosophy is **let them taste everything, gate on publish/use**
- Plan badge as clickable text pill — tapping 'Free' badge should lead to pricing page as a subtle upgrade path
- Stripe Customer Portal for heavy lifting — minimize custom billing UI, let Stripe handle invoices and payment methods
