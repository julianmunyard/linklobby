# Phase 4.2: Linktree Import - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

One-click import of existing Linktree links to reduce switching friction. Users enter a Linktree username/URL, we fetch their links and create cards on the canvas. One-time import only — no ongoing Linktree connection.

## Implementation Decisions

### Import Flow UX
- Entry point: Empty state prompt ("Import from Linktree" when canvas is empty)
- Input format: Accept both username ("artistname") and full URL ("linktr.ee/artistname"), auto-detect
- Post-import: Cards appear on canvas immediately, toast shows "Imported X links"
- No preview/confirmation step — just import and show

### Card Type Mapping
- **Randomized layout pattern** — NOT all horizontal links like Linktree
- Goal: Immediate "this is different" feeling when import completes
- Pattern-based randomization to create visual rhythm (mix of hero, horizontal, square small, square big)
- Layout pattern decides card type — platform detection does NOT override
- Spotify/YouTube/etc. links still get appropriate card types based on layout, not forced to embed types

### Content Handling
- Import thumbnails if available, graceful fallback if not (download and re-upload to our storage)
- Preserve original Linktree link order (top to bottom)
- Skip special Linktree blocks (headers, dividers, text-only) — only import clickable links
- Import descriptions where our card types support them (Hero has description field)

### Edge Cases
- Invalid/private page: Clear error message — "This Linktree page is private or doesn't exist. Check the username."
- Empty page: Friendly message — "No links found on this Linktree. Add some links manually instead."
- Existing cards: Ask user — "You have existing cards. Add to them or start fresh?"
- Rate limiting/blocking: Must be handled via research — need reliable fetching method

### Claude's Discretion
- Progress feedback style during import
- Exact layout pattern algorithm for visual rhythm
- Technical approach to fetching Linktree pages reliably
- Error handling for partial failures (some links import, some fail)

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- "I want it to look different from Linktree immediately" — the randomized card types are the key differentiator
- User should feel "oh, this is already more interesting" after import completes
- Import is a quick win for user acquisition — reduce friction of switching

</specifics>

## Deferred Ideas

- Profile photo/bio import — Phase 4.4 (Profile Editor) handles profile-level content
- Platform-specific embeds (Spotify player, YouTube embed) — Phase 9 (Platform Integrations)

</deferred>

## Research Requirements

**CRITICAL:** Researcher must investigate how to reliably fetch Linktree pages:
- Does Linktree have a public API?
- Can we scrape their rendered HTML?
- What headers/user-agents avoid blocking?
- Any rate limits to respect?
- Fallback strategies if primary method fails

This is a hard requirement before implementation.
