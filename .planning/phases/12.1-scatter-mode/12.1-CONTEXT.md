# Phase 12.1: Scatter Mode - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Freeform card positioning system for select themes. Artists can toggle scatter mode ON for supported themes, freely drag cards anywhere on a canvas, freely resize cards to any dimensions, and save that layout. Public pages render exactly as the artist arranged. Optional visitor drag toggle lets public page visitors move cards around (resets on refresh). Non-scatter themes continue using existing flow layout.

## Implementation Decisions

### Canvas interaction (artist dashboard)
- Positioning is **totally free** — no snap-to-grid enforced
- **Visual grid overlay** appears in preview when scatter mode is active, so artists can optionally align cards to it
- **Z-index: last moved on top** — dragging a card brings it to front automatically, no manual layer controls
- **Free resize** — artists can drag corners/edges to resize cards to any dimensions, content inside scales perfectly
- **No minimum size** — full creative freedom, cards can be as small as the artist wants
- **Stay within bounds** — cards cannot be dragged off-screen, constrained to canvas edges

### Visitor drag behavior (public page)
- Visitor drag is an **opt-in toggle** the artist enables alongside scatter mode
- Visitor rearrangements **reset on refresh** — every visit starts fresh with the artist's layout, dragging is just for fun
- **No visual hint** that cards are draggable — visitors discover it naturally, keeps the page clean
- **Within screen bounds** — visitors can't drag cards off the visible area
- **Click vs drag distinction:** immediate — tapping/clicking follows the link, holding and moving drags the card. No delay or hold timer. Simple pointer-move activation distance.

### Theme assignment
- Scatter mode available on **5 themes only:** Mac OS, Instagram Reels, System Settings, Macintosh, and Word Art
- **Artist toggle** — scatter mode is NOT always on. Artist enables it via a toggle with clear signalling about what it does. Placement TBD (likely Style controls area)
- **Visitor drag toggle** lives in the same location as scatter toggle — enabling scatter reveals the visitor drag option below it
- **Positions saved per-theme** — each scatter theme stores its own layout independently. Switching to a non-scatter theme (e.g. iPod) renders normally with flow layout. Switching back to a scatter theme restores the saved layout.

### Responsive handling
- **Mobile-first** — the mobile preview is the source of truth for scatter layout
- **Both views editable** — artist can arrange in mobile or desktop preview, but mobile is primary (matching current preview default)
- **Positions stored as percentages** of canvas — layout scales proportionally across screen sizes
- **Card sizes also percentage-based** — dimensions stored relative to canvas so the whole layout stays proportional. The card is the size the artist made it, scaling naturally with the viewport.

### Claude's Discretion
- Grid overlay visual design (color, spacing, opacity)
- Exact activation distance for click vs drag distinction on public pages
- Scatter mode toggle UI design and placement within style controls
- How free resize handles appear (corners, edges, visual affordance)
- Database schema for storing scatter positions and dimensions per theme

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Grid overlay in dashboard preview is for optional alignment guidance — similar to design tool guides
- Visitor drag is a "hidden delight" — no cursor change, no animation, visitors just discover they can move things
- Artist's scatter layout is the canonical layout — visitor drag is ephemeral fun that resets
