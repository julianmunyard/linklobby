# Phase 4.4: Profile Editor - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Artists can edit their profile header information (name, photo, title, social icons) displayed at the top of their public page. This includes a universal image upload/crop component that will be used for both profile images AND card images throughout the app.

## Implementation Decisions

### Image Upload & Cropping (Universal Component)
- **Entry flow**: Click upload → popup with two options: "Upload your own" (enabled) + "Choose from icons" (disabled/greyed out, coming in later phase)
- **After file selection**: Image loads into crop popup
- **Crop presets**: FREE + RECTANGLE + SQUARE + RESET buttons (like Linktree reference)
- **This component is shared** across all image uploads (profile photo, profile logo, card images)
- Crop popup has aspect ratio presets at top, image with crop handles below, Save button at bottom

### Profile Section Location
- Profile editing lives in the **Design tab** (not a separate tab)
- Section labeled "Header" at top of Design tab

### Profile Header Fields
- **Profile photo**: Circle avatar with Edit button
- **Profile image layout**: Classic (small circle) OR Hero (larger/banner style) — both available
- **Title style**: Text OR Logo — toggle to choose
  - If Text: shows text input field + size picker
  - If Logo: shows logo upload (uses same crop component)
- **Title size**: Small or Large (two options)
- **Display name text field**: When title style is "Text"
- **No bio field** — not needed

### Social Icons Row
- **Toggle in profile settings**: "Show social icons in header" on/off
- If off, artist can add social icons as a card instead (moveable)
- **Platform selection**: Popup with icon grid
  - Big 5 enabled now: Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Spotify, Twitter/X
  - Other platforms shown but greyed out / "Coming soon"
- After selecting platform → enter profile URL
- **Drag to reorder** icons in the row

### Live Preview Behavior
- **Subtle fade transition** when profile changes update in preview
- **Auto-scroll to header** when artist opens profile editing section
- Crop preview updates **after Save only** (not live during crop adjustment)

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact crop component library choice (react-image-crop, react-easy-crop, etc.)
- Hero layout exact dimensions and styling
- Icon grid popup layout and sizing
- Fade transition duration and easing

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Reference: Linktree's Header settings panel (screenshot provided) — similar structure with profile photo, layout options, title style toggle, size options
- Reference: Linktree's crop interface — FREE/RECTANGLE/SQUARE presets with RESET button, crop handles on image
- "Choose from icons" option is shown but disabled — sets up for Phase 9 Platform Integrations icon library

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Icon library for "Choose from icons" option — Phase 9 Platform Integrations
- Additional social platforms beyond Big 5 — Phase 9 Platform Integrations
- Username editing with availability check — out of scope for v1 profile editor

</deferred>
