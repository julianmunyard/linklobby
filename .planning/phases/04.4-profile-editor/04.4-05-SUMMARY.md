# Phase 04.4 Plan 05: Social Icons Editor Summary

**Social icon picker dialog with Big 5 platform grid and horizontally sortable icon editor using dnd-kit**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-26T10:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-26T10:08:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Two-step SocialIconPicker dialog: platform grid then URL input
- SocialIconsEditor with horizontal drag-reorder via dnd-kit
- PLATFORM_ICONS mapping using Lucide icons for Big 5 platforms
- Remove button on hover with visual feedback

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create SocialIconPicker component** - `881f431` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create SocialIconsEditor component** - `ffaea8f` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/components/editor/social-icon-picker.tsx` - Two-step dialog for adding social icons with platform selection and URL input
- `src/components/editor/social-icons-editor.tsx` - Horizontal sortable list of social icons with drag-reorder and remove

## Decisions Made
- **Export PLATFORM_ICONS:** Exported from social-icon-picker for reuse in social-icons-editor (DRY)
- **4px activation distance:** Smaller than cards (8px) since icons are smaller targets
- **Hover remove button:** Destructive red circle with X, only visible on hover to keep UI clean

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Social icon components ready for integration into HeaderSection (plan 04)
- Components can be used together: SocialIconPicker adds icons, SocialIconsEditor manages them
- Both components use useProfileStore - full store integration complete
