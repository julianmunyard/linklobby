# Plan 04.4-07 Summary: Profile-Preview Sync

## What Was Built

Profile header component for the preview iframe with live sync from the editor.

## Artifacts Created/Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/components/preview/profile-header.tsx` | Created ProfileHeader component |
| `src/components/preview/preview-page.tsx` | Wired ProfileHeader above cards |

## Key Implementation Details

- ProfileHeader renders avatar, display name, logo, and social icons
- Supports Classic and Hero layout modes
- Live updates via Zustand store (useProfileStore)
- Social icons display with platform icons when toggle is ON
- Profile state synced to preview iframe via postMessage STATE_UPDATE

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Profile sync via postMessage | Preview iframe has separate Zustand instance - sync profile state in STATE_UPDATE message |
| showAvatar toggle | User can hide profile photo entirely via Switch toggle |
| Independent title/logo toggles | Removed titleStyle either/or, showTitle and showLogo are independent |

## Verification

- Profile header visible at top of preview
- Layout toggle changes preview appearance (Classic vs Hero)
- Title shows as text or logo based on settings
- Social icons render when enabled
- Live updates: editing immediately reflects in preview
