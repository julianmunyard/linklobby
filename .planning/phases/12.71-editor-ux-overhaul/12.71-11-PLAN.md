  <what-built>Complete Editor UX Overhaul — direct manipulation editing, simplified card creation, floating toolbar, inline editing, text line breaks, image compression, gallery fixes, featured tab templates, font picker in Title Edit, photo crop improvements</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. **Click-to-navigate:** Click the title area in the preview → should jump to Design > Title Edit section. Click empty background → should open Design > Style tab.
    2. **Inline title editing:** Click the display name text in preview → should become editable. Type new name, click away → name updates in editor panel.
    3. **Inline bio editing:** Click bio text in preview → editable with multiline. Press Enter → line break. Click away → bio saves.
    4. **Inline text card editing:** Click a text card in preview → text becomes editable. Type, blur → saves.
    5. **Floating toolbar:** Select any card in preview (desktop) → floating toolbar appears above it with Delete/Duplicate icons. Test both actions.
    6. **Add Link dropdown:** Check that "Add Link" button shows only content types (Link, Music, Audio, Video, Photo Gallery, Game, Email Collection, Release, Social Icons). No Hero/Square/Horizontal/Mini/Text options.
    7. **Title Edit section:** Design tab shows "Title Edit" (not "Header"). Font picker controls are embedded there.
    8. **Text line breaks:** Create a text card, type multiline text in editor → preview and public page show line breaks.
    9. **Gallery photos:** Gallery carousel photos fill frame edge-to-edge (no side gaps).
    10. **Photo crop:** Photo cards show crop icon (not pencil). Clicking it opens crop dialog.
    11. **Featured tab:** Click a featured theme → shows template picker (not immediate apply). "Create Your Own" option at end of list.
    12. **Public page:** Visit a public page → no contentEditable elements, no floating toolbar, no editor-only features visible.
