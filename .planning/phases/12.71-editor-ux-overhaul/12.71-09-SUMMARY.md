  - Collapsible "Fonts" subsection with heading/body font, size, weight, and preview
affects: [12.71-10, 12.71-11]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:

  patterns:
    - "Reuse self-contained store-connected components by direct import — no prop threading needed"

    - src/components/editor/header-section.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "FontPicker placed at bottom of Title Edit's CollapsibleContent — after Social Icons, logically grouped with header text controls"
  - "defaultOpen=false for Fonts section to keep the panel compact by default"
  - "Font picker left in its original Design tab location as well — both reference same theme store and stay in sync"

patterns-established:
  - "Store-backed UI components (FontPicker) can be embedded anywhere without prop changes — they self-subscribe to theme store"

# Phase 12.71 Plan 09: Embed Font Picker in Title Edit Summary

**FontPicker embedded as collapsible "Fonts" subsection in Title Edit panel, giving artists one-click access to heading/body font, size, weight, and preview without leaving the header editing context**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~1 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-26T05:43:16Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-26T05:44:00Z
- **Tasks:** 1 of 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- FontPicker imported and rendered inside HeaderSection's CollapsibleContent
- "Fonts" collapsible section added after Social Icons, collapsed by default to keep the panel tidy
- Heading font selector, heading size/weight, body font selector, body size, and inline preview all accessible from Title Edit
- Font changes propagate to preview immediately via shared `useThemeStore` subscription (no additional wiring needed)
- Font picker in Design tab remains untouched — both locations share the same theme store state

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Embed font picker in Title Edit section** - `8726069` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** _(forthcoming docs commit)_

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/editor/header-section.tsx` - Added `FontPicker` import and "Fonts" `CollapsibleSection` at end of Title Edit controls

## Decisions Made

- Placed the Fonts section at the bottom of the collapsible content (after Social Icons) so it groups logically with header-related controls without disrupting the existing section order.
- Used `defaultOpen={false}` — the full FontPicker (font selector + size slider + weight toggle + preview) is not trivially compact, so collapsing it by default keeps the panel clean for users who aren't changing fonts.
- Did not remove FontPicker from the Design/Style tab — the plan explicitly allows dual placement, and both stay in sync through the store.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Font picker accessible from Title Edit section — plan 09 objective met
- No blockers for remaining phase 12.71 plans (10, 11)
