# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 12.71-editor-ux-overhaul
    provides: handleNavigateToTheme already wired from EditorPanel to FeaturedThemesTab
provides:
  - Featured tab card click navigates to Design > Templates filtered by theme
  - Create Your Own blank canvas option with confirmation guard
  - handleNavigateToLinks handler in EditorPanel
affects:
  - 12.71-editor-ux-overhaul (featured tab UX, template-first flow)

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Navigate-first pattern: featured theme cards show templates before applying (not apply-on-click)"
    - "onNavigateToLinks callback: EditorPanel passes tab-switch function as prop to child tabs"

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - src/components/editor/featured-themes-tab.tsx
    - src/components/editor/editor-panel.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "Removed entire applyTemplate + confirm-dialog flow from FeaturedThemesTab — template picker handles apply step"
  - "Create Your Own navigates to Links tab (not Design) so user can immediately start adding content"
  - "Confirmation dialog only shown when cards.length > 0 to avoid unnecessary friction"

patterns-established:
  - "Tab navigation from child components: pass onNavigateToXxx callbacks from EditorPanel"

# Phase 12.71 Plan 08: Featured Themes Template-First Navigation Summary

**Featured theme clicks now route to template picker instead of applying directly; Create Your Own card added with blank canvas + confirmation flow**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-26T05:36:35Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-26T05:44:00Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Featured theme card click now navigates to Design > Templates subtab filtered by that theme, letting user choose which template to apply
- Removed the old apply-on-click + confirm-dialog flow from FeaturedThemesTab entirely
- Added "Create Your Own" card (dashed border, Plus icon) at end of featured grid — clears cards, keeps theme, navigates to Links tab
- Confirmation dialog protects against accidental card deletion when cards exist
- Added `handleNavigateToLinks` in EditorPanel and wired it as `onNavigateToLinks` prop

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Featured theme click navigates to templates; add Create Your Own** - `19244d4` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (see below)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/editor/featured-themes-tab.tsx` - Replaced apply-on-click with navigate-to-theme; added Create Your Own card and confirmation dialog
- `src/components/editor/editor-panel.tsx` - Added handleNavigateToLinks handler; updated FeaturedThemesTab props

## Decisions Made

- Removed `applyTemplate`, `pendingTemplate`, `showConfirm` state and entire apply flow from FeaturedThemesTab — the template picker already handles the apply step with its own confirm UX
- `onTemplateApplied` prop kept in interface as optional for backward compatibility but no longer used in this component
- Create Your Own navigates to Links tab (not Design) because the user's next intent after clearing is to add their own content, not browse themes
- Used `window.confirm()` equivalent (AlertDialog) only when `cards.length > 0` to avoid friction on empty pages

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Featured tab now provides a discovery-first flow (see templates before committing)
- Create Your Own blank canvas flow is functional
- Links tab auto-opens after Create Your Own so user can start adding content immediately
