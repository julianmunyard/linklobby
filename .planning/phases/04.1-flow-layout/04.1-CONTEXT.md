# Phase 4.1: Flow Layout - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Cards can be sized (Big/Small) with flow layout enabling side-by-side arrangement. Small cards can be positioned left/center/right within their row via drag. This extends the existing canvas system from vertical stack to a flow grid.

## Implementation Decisions

### Size system
- Only 2 sizes: **Big** and **Small**
- Big = full width (current behavior)
- Small = half width (2 cards fit side by side)
- Rename from "Large/Medium/Small" to "Big/Small"

### Card type sizing
- **Square card**: Big and Small options
- **Hero card**: Big and Small options
- **Horizontal card**: No sizing (always full width by nature)

### Flow behavior
- Cards flow left to right, then wrap down
- Big cards take full row
- Small cards share rows (2 per row max)
- Order: vertical position (row) takes priority, horizontal position within row

### Positioning
- Small cards can be positioned: Left, Center, or Right
- Position set via **drag in preview** (not dropdown)
- Requires storing horizontal position for small cards

### Mobile responsiveness
- Small cards **stay half-width** on mobile
- No breakpoint changes - layout is consistent across devices

### Drag behavior
- **Show visual drop zones** when dragging
- Drop zones indicate left/center/right positions for small cards
- Full-width drop zone for big cards

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- User described wanting it "like Mac folder icons" for small cards - compact, arrangeable
- The position should feel like dragging items on a desktop - place them where you want
