## Accumulated Decisions

| Decision | Phase | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| sonner instead of toast | 01-01 | toast deprecated in shadcn v3.7.0 |
| @supabase/ssr for auth | 01-01 | Official SSR pattern, replaces deprecated auth-helpers |
| getUser() not getSession() | 01-01 | Security: getUser() validates JWT with Supabase server |
| User ran schema manually | 01-02 | Supabase project already existed |
| React Hook Form + Zod | 01-03 | Form validation pattern |
| Zustand for state management | 02-01 | Lightweight, no boilerplate |
| hasChanges pattern | 02-01 | Set on mutations, cleared on save |
| collapsible="icon" sidebar | 02-02 | Sidebar collapses to icon mode |
| Cookie persistence for UI state | 02-02 | sidebar_state cookie read server-side |
| react-resizable-panels v4 API | 02-03 | Group/Panel/Separator replaces PanelGroup/PanelResizeHandle |
| orientation prop not direction | 02-03 | v4 API change for panel orientation |
| postMessage origin check | 02-04 | Security: only accept same-origin messages |
| useDefaultLayout for persistence | 02-04 | v4 pattern for panel layout persistence |
| Capture phase for link clicks | 02-05 | Intercept before React handlers |
| PREVIEW_READY message | 02-05 | Reliable iframe state sync |
| Client wrapper pattern | 02-05 | Separate client hooks from server components |
| dnd-kit over react-beautiful-dnd | 03-01 | Actively maintained, React 19 compatible |
| Fractional-indexing for order | 03-01 | Single UPDATE not N updates on reorder |
| Predefined card sizes | 03-01 | Small/Medium/Large not free resize |
| sortKey for ordering | 03-01 | Vertical stack uses 1D ordering, ignore position_x/y |
| Drag handle isolation | 03-03 | touch-none on handle allows page scroll on mobile |
| Hydration guard pattern | 03-03 | dnd-kit ID mismatch between server/client |
| 8px activation distance | 03-03 | Prevents accidental drags |
| getSortedCards computed | 03-04 | Store returns cards in display order |
| selectedCardId for selection | 03-04 | Track selected card for property editing |
| fetchUserPage for API auth | 03-05 | Reusable auth pattern for card routes |
| mapDbToCard/mapCardToDb helpers | 03-05 | sortKey <-> sort_key field mapping |
| useMemo for sorted cards | 03-06 | Avoid infinite loop from getSortedCards() selector |
| size column in database | 03-06 | Card size persists with card data |
| Card-type specific content schemas | 04-01 | Type safety for card components vs generic Record |
| 5MB upload limit client-side | 04-01 | Better UX than server rejection |
| cardId/uuid.ext upload structure | 04-01 | Groups images by card, unique filenames |
| Deferred image deletion | 04-01 | Orphan cleanup via background job, avoid accidental loss |
